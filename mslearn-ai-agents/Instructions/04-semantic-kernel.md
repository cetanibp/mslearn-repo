# Develop an Azure AI agent with the Semantic Kernel SDK

In this exercise you'll use Azure AI Agent Service and Semantic Kernel to create an AI agent that creates an expense claim email.

This exercise should take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

## Create an Azure AI Foundry project

Let's start by creating an Azure AI Foundry project.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Azure AI Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image:

    ![Screenshot of Azure AI Foundry portal.](./Media/ai-foundry-home.png)

1. In the home page, select **+ Create project**.
1. In the **Create a project** wizard, enter a suitable project name for (for example, `my-ai-project`) and if an existing hub is suggested, choose the option to create a new one. Then review the Azure resources that will be automatically created to support your hub and project.
1. Select **Customize** and specify the following settings for your hub:
    - **Hub name**: *A unique name - for example `my-ai-hub`*
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Create a new resource group with a unique name (for example, `my-ai-resources`), or select an existing one*
    - **Location**: **Location**: Select any of the following regions\*:
        - East US
        - Japan East
        - UK South
        - West US
    - **Connect Azure AI Services or Azure OpenAI**: *Create a new AI Services resource with an appropriate name (for example, `my-ai-services`) or use an existing one*
    - **Connect Azure AI Search**: Skip connecting

   > \* At the time of writing, the OpenAI *gpt-35-turbo* model we're going to use in this exercise is available for use with agents in these regions. You can check the latest regional availability for specific models in the [Azure AI Foundry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/deploy-models-serverless-availability#region-availability). In the event of a regional quota limit being reached later in the exercise, there's a possibility you may need to create another resource in a different region.

1. Select **Next** and review your configuration. Then select **Create** and wait for the process to complete.
1. When your project is created, close any tips that are displayed and review the project page in Azure AI Foundry portal, which should look similar to the following image:

    ![Screenshot of a Azure AI project details in Azure AI Foundry portal.](./Media/ai-foundry-project.png)

1. In the project overview page, in the **Project details** area, note the **Project connection string**. Later, you'll use this connection string to connect to your project in a client application.

## Deploy a generative AI model

Now you're ready to deploy a generative AI language model to support your agent.

1. In the toolbar at the top right of your Azure AI Foundry project page, use the **Preview features** icon to ensure that the **Deploy models to Azure AI model inference service** feature is enabled. This feature ensures your model is deployed to the Azure AI Inference service.
1. In the pane on the left for your project, in the **My assets** section, select the **Models + endpoints** page.
1. In the **Models + endpoints** page, in the **Model deployments** tab, in the **+ Deploy model** menu, select **Deploy base model**.
1. Search for the `gpt-35-turbo` model in the list, and then select and confirm it.
1. Deploy the model with the following settings by selecting **Customize** in the deployment details:

    **<font color="red">It's important to choose exactly these settings - otherwise your agent may not work</font>**

    - **Deployment name**: *A unique name for your model deployment - for example `gpt-35-turbo` (remember the name you choose - you'll need it later)*
    - **Deployment type**: Standard
    - **Model version**: 0125
    - **Connected AI resource**: *Select your Azure OpenAI resource connection*
    - **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit (thousands)**: 10K
    - **Content filter**: DefaultV2
    - **Enable dynamic quota**: Enabled
      
    > **Note**: Reducing the TPM helps avoid over-using the quota available in the subscription you are using. 10,000 TPM should be sufficient for the data used in this exercise. If you later experience a *Rate Limit Reached* error, you can edit the model deployment to increase this value.

1. Wait for the deployment provisioning state to be **Completed**.

## Create an agent client app

Now you're ready to create a client app that defines an agent and a custom function. Some code has been provided for you in a GitHub repository.

### Prepare the environment

1. Open a new browser tab (keeping the Azure AI Foundry portal open in the existing tab). Then in the new tab, browse to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`; signing in with your Azure credentials if prompted.
1. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment. The cloud shell provides a command line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal.

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, switch it to ***PowerShell***.

1. In the PowerShell pane, enter the following commands to clone the GitHub repo containing the code files for this exercise:

    ```
   rm -r ai-agents -f
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents ai-agents
    ```

    > **Tip**: As you enter commands into the cloudshell, the ouput may take up a large amount of the screen buffer and the cursor on the current line may be obscured. You can clear the screen by entering the `cls` command to make it easier to focus on each task.

1. When the repo has been cloned, enter the following command to install the required version of Python in the cloud shell:

    ```
   sh ~/ai-agents/Labfiles/update-python.sh
    ```

1. After the installation is complete, in the cloud shell toolbar, in the **Settings** menu, select **Go to Classic version** (this starts a new session, and is required to use the code editor).

    **<font color="red">Ensure you've switched to the classic version of the cloud shell and a new session has started before continuing.</font>**

1. Enter the following command to change the working directory to the folder containing the code files and list them all.

    ```
   cd ai-agents/Labfiles/04-semantic-kernel/python
   ls -a -l
    ```

    The provided files include application code and a file for configuration settings.

### Configure the application settings

1. In the cloud shell command line pane, enter the following command to install the libraries you'll use:

    ```
   pip install python-dotenv azure-identity semantic-kernel[azure] 
    ```

    > **Note**: Installing *semantic-kernel[azure]* autmatically installs a semantic kernel-compatible version of *azure-ai-projects*.

1. Enter the following command to edit the configuration file that has been provided:

    ```
   code .env
    ```

    The file is opened in a code editor.

1. In the code file, replace the **your_project_connection_string** placeholder with the connection string for your project (copied from the project **Overview** page in the Azure AI Foundry portal), and the **your_model_deployment** placeholder with the name you assigned to your gpt-35-turbo model deployment.
1. After you've replaced the placeholders, use the **CTRL+S** command to save your changes and then use the **CTRL+Q** command to close the code editor while keeping the cloud shell command line open.

### Write code for an agent app

> **Tip**: As you add code, be sure to maintain the correct indentation. Use the existing comments as a guide, entering the new code at the same level of indentation.

1. Enter the following command to edit the agent code file that has been provided:

    ```
   code semantic-kernel.py
    ```

1. Review the code in the file. It contains:
    - Some **import** statements to add references to commonly used namespaces
    - A *main* function that defines data for an expense claim (in a real application, this would likely be submitted as a file) and then calls...
    - A **create_expense_claim** function in which the code to create and use your agent must be added
    - An **EmailPlugin** class that includes a kernel function named **send_email**; which will be used by your agent to simulate the functionality used to send an email.

1. At the top of the file, after the existing **import** statement, find the comment **Add references**, and add the following code to reference the namespaces in the libraries you will need to implement your agent:

    ```python
   # Add references
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential
   from semantic_kernel.agents.azure_ai import AzureAIAgent, AzureAIAgentSettings
   from semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_function
   from typing import Annotated
    ```

1. Near the bottom of the file, find the comment **Create a Plugin for the email functionality**, and add the following code to define a class for a plugin containing a function that your agent will use to send email:

    ```python
   # Create a Plugin for the email functionality
   class EmailPlugin:
       """A Plugin to simulate email functionality."""
    
       @kernel_function(description="Sends an email.")
       def send_email(self,
                      to: Annotated[str, "Who to send the email to"],
                      subject: Annotated[str, "The subject of the email."],
                      body: Annotated[str, "The text body of the email."]):
           print("\nTo:", to)
           print("Subject:", subject)
           print(body, "\n")
    ```

    > **Note**: The function *simulates* sending an email by printing it to the console. In a real application, you'd use an SMTP service or similar to actually send the email!

1. Back up above the new **EmailPlugin** class code, in the **create_expense_claim** function, find the comment **Get configuration settings**, and add the following code to load the configuration file and create an **AzureAIAgentSettings** object (which will automatically include the Azure AI Agent settings from the configuration).

    (Be sure to maintain the indentation level)

    ```python
   # Get configuration settings
   load_dotenv()
   ai_agent_settings = AzureAIAgentSettings.create()
    ```

1. Find the comment **Connect to the Azure AI Foundry project**, and add the following code to connect to your Azure AI Foundry project using the Azure credentials you are currently signed in with.

    (Be sure to maintain the indentation level)

    ```python
   # Connect to the Azure AI Foundry project
   async with (
       DefaultAzureCredential(
           exclude_environment_credential=True,
           exclude_managed_identity_credential=True) as creds,
       AzureAIAgent.create_client(
           credential=creds,
           conn_str=ai_agent_settings.project_connection_string.get_secret_value(),
       ) as project_client,
   ):
    ```

1. Find the comment **Define an Azure AI agent that sends an expense claim email**, and add the following code to create an Azure AI Agent definition for your agent.

    (Be sure to maintain the indentation level)

    ```python
   # Define an Azure AI agent that sends an expense claim email
   expenses_agent_def = await project_client.agents.create_agent(
       model= ai_agent_settings.model_deployment_name,
       name="expenses_agent",
       instructions="Send an expense claim to expenses@contoso.com with the subject 'Expense Claim`and a body that contains itemized expenses with a total."
   )
    ```

1. Find the comment **Create a  semantic kernel agent**, and add the following code to create asemantic kernel agent object for your Azure AI agent, and includes a reference to the **EmailPlugin** plugin.

    (Be sure to maintain the indentation level)

    ```python
   # Create a semantic kernel agent
   expenses_agent = AzureAIAgent(
       client=project_client,
       definition=expenses_agent_def,
       plugins=[EmailPlugin()]
   )
    ```

1. Find the comment **Use the agent to generate an expense claim email**, and add the following code to create a thread for your agent to run on, and then invoke it with a chat message.

    (Be sure to maintain the indentation level):

    ```python
   # Use the agent to generate an expense claim email
   thread = await project_client.agents.create_thread()

   try:
       # Add the user input as a chat message
       prompt_message = "Create an expense claim for the following expenses: " + expenses_data
       await expenses_agent.add_chat_message(thread_id=thread.id, message=prompt_message)
       # Invoke the agent for the specified thread for response
       response = await expenses_agent.get_response(thread_id=thread.id)
       print(f"\n# {response.name}:\n{response}")
   except Exception as e:
       # Something went wrong
       print (e)
   finally:
       # Cleanup: Delete the thread and agent
       await project_client.agents.delete_thread(thread.id)
       await project_client.agents.delete_agent(expenses_agent.id)
    ```

1. Verify that the completed code for your agent looks like this, and then save your code changes (**CTRL+S**).

    ```python
   import os                                                       
   import asyncio

   from semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_function
    
   async def main():
       # Clear the console
       os.system('cls' if os.name=='nt' else 'clear')
    
       # Create expense claim data
       data = """{'expenses':[
                   {'date':'07-Mar-2025','description':'taxi','amount':24.00},

                   {'date':'07-Mar-2025','description':'hotel','amount':125.90}]
               }
               """
    
       # Run the async agent code
       await create_expense_claim(data)
    
   async def create_expense_claim(expenses_data):
    
       # Get configuration settings
       load_dotenv()
       ai_agent_settings = AzureAIAgentSettings.create()
    
       # Connect to the Azure AI Foundry project
       async with (
           DefaultAzureCredential(
               exclude_environment_credential=True,

               instructions="Send an expense claim to expenses@contoso.com with the subject 'Expense Claim`and a body that contains itemized expenses with a total."
           )
    
           # Create a semantic kernel agent
           expenses_agent = AzureAIAgent(
               client=project_client,
               definition=expenses_agent_def,
               plugins=[EmailPlugin()]
           )

           except Exception as e:
               # Something went wrong
               print (e)
           finally:
               # Cleanup: Delete the thread and agent
               await project_client.agents.delete_thread(thread.id)
               await project_client.agents.delete_agent(expenses_agent.id)
    

   # Create a Plugin for the email functionality
   class EmailPlugin:
       """A Plugin to simulate email functionality."""
    
       @kernel_function(description="Sends an email.")
       def send_email(self,
           to: Annotated[str, "Who to send the email to"],
           subject: Annotated[str, "The subject of the email."],
           body: Annotated[str, "The text body of the email."]):
           print("\nTo:", to)
           print("Subject:", subject)
           print(body, "\n")
    
    
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       asyncio.run(main())
    ```
    

### Sign into Azure and run the app

**<font color="red">You must sign into Azure - even though the cloud shell session is already authenticated.</font>**

1. In the cloud shell command line pane beneath the code editor, enter the following command to sign into Azure.

    ```
    az login
    ```
    
1. When prompted, follow the instructions to open the sign-in page in a new tab and enter the authentication code provided and your Azure credentials. Then complete the sign in process in the command line, selecting the subscription containing your Azure AI Foundry hub if prompted.
1. After you have signed in, enter the following command to run the application:

    ```
   python semantic-kernel.py
    ```
    
    The application runs using the credentials for your authenticated Azure session to connect to your project and create and run the agent.

1. When the application has finished, review the output. The agent should have composed an email for an expenses claim based on the data that was provided.

## Summary

In this exercise, you used the Azure AI Agent Service SDK and Semantic Kernel to create an agent.

## Clean up

If you've finished exploring Azure AI Agent Service, you should delete the resources you have created in this exercise to avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs.

1. Return to the browser tab containing the Azure portal (or re-open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com` in a new browser tab) and view the contents of the resource group where you deployed the resources used in this exercise.
1. On the toolbar, select **Delete resource group**.
1. Enter the resource group name and confirm that you want to delete it.
